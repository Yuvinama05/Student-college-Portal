                <h1>Welcome To Student-College Portal</h1>
                <p>A Student-College Portal is a web-based platform that helps colleges take
                    student data online for easier management and better clarity. That's at its most basic. </p>

                <p> This system is able to collect college-wide data online so that it can be easily accessed by
                    teachers, parents, students, and administrators. That includes personal student information, grades,
                    records of tests, attendance, and plenty more. <br> </p>

                <p> Essentially, this allows the college to make data points for lots of areas in one place so that it's
                    easy to keep track of progress and performance. <br> </p>

                <p> To be clear, it's an SIS(Student Information System) we're talking about here, which can also break
                    down into a Student
                    Management System (SMS), Student Information Management System (SIMS), or Student Records System
                    (SRS) - all created to help keep records digitally. <br> </p>

                <p> These systems can be used within a college for student data or information on the college as a
                    whole.
                    But the platforms can also be used to manage multiple institutions district-wide, say, to get a
                    clearer view of how college compare on very specific <br></p>
